# Replit.md

## Overview

CactiTracker is a full-stack web application for managing plant collections, specifically focused on cacti and succulents. The application allows users to track their plants, monitor growth, and manage their botanical collections with a clean, modern interface.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

The application follows a modern full-stack architecture with clear separation between frontend and backend components:

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **UI Framework**: Shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom botanical theme colors
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with TypeScript
- **Framework**: Express.js for REST API
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (serverless PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication**: Replit Auth with OpenID Connect (OIDC)
- **Session Management**: Express sessions stored in PostgreSQL

### Project Structure
The application uses a monorepo structure with shared schemas:
- `client/` - React frontend application
- `server/` - Express backend API
- `shared/` - Shared TypeScript types and Zod schemas
- `migrations/` - Database migration files

## Key Components

### Authentication System
- **Provider**: Replit Auth integration with multiple OAuth providers (Google, GitHub, Microsoft, Apple)
- **Session Storage**: PostgreSQL-backed sessions using connect-pg-simple
- **Authorization**: Protected routes requiring authentication
- **User Management**: Automatic user creation and profile management
- **Provider Tracking**: authProvider field tracks which OAuth method was used
