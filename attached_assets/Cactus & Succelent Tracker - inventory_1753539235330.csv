TRI-SCOP-MBBB-1,cactus,Trichocereus,scopulicola,MBxBB,,MBxBB,Cactus Jones,6/25/2025,pup,"In the context of Trichocereus scopulicola ""MB x BB"", the abbreviations MB and BB refer to the parent plants involved in the hybridization:

MB stands for Michael B, a collector or grower who maintained a notable scopulicola-type plant. It’s sometimes also referred to as MB scopulicola or MB scop in the community. This plant is known for its blue-green skin, short spines, and classic scopulicola traits.

BB typically stands for Backeberg, referring to a scopulicola clone that traces back to Curt Backeberg, the German cactus collector and taxonomist. The “BB” clone is one of the earlier distributed scopulicola lines and is often considered a classic or foundational scopulicola phenotype in cultivation."

SS01: A short-spined Trichocereus bridgesii (a.k.a. Echinopsis lageniformis) clone with strong, robust growth and often considered to have good ornamental form.

SS02: A long-spined Trichocereus bridgesii clone, also very vigorous. It typically has a more aggressive appearance than SS01."
